  Abstract                 = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Les réseaux d’interactions sont formellement représentés par des graphes. De très nombreux modèles de graphes aléatoires ont été étudiés dans la littérature, souvent de manière heuristique. Après les avoir passés en revue, nous en introduisons deux nouveaux : le modèle à attachement connexe et le modèle à seuil. Chacun engendre une suite aléatoire croissante de graphes et est suffisamment général pour englober plusieurs modèles de la littérature comme cas particuliers. Les graphes du modèle à attachement connexe possèdent une composante connexe non triviale unique. Nous démontrons d’abord des résultats portant sur le nombre et la proportion de sommets isolés. Puis dans un cas particulier, le modèle du marcheur à un pas, nous conjecturons que pour chaque sommet u, presque sûrement, l’un des deux évènements disjoints suivants est réalisé, chacun avec probabilité non nulle : soit u est de degré borné, soit la proportion des sommets du graphe voisins de u converge vers une variable aléatoire non nulle. Nous nous intéressons ensuite à l’asymptotique du degré moyen d’un sommet pour les graphes engendrés par le modèle à seuil. Cela motive l’introduction de chaînes de Markov particulières pour lesquelles nous donnons des conditions de récurrence et de transience. Complex network are formally represented as graphs. Numerous random graphs models have been studied in the literature, often with heuristic methods. After reviewing them, we introduce two new models: the connected attachment model and the threshold model. Each of them generates an increasing random sequence of graphs and is general enough to include several models of the literature as particular cases. The graphs generated by the connected attachment model have a unique nontrivial connected component. First, we prove several results on the number and the ratio of isolated vertices. Then, in a particular case called the one-step walker model, we conjecture that for each vertex u, almost surely, one of the two following disjoint events occurs, each with positive probability: either u has bounded degree or the ratio of neighbors of u in the graph converges to a positive random variable. Then, we focus on the asymptotic of the mean degree of a vertex for the graphs generated by the threshold model. This motivates the introduction of particular Markov chains for which recurrence and transience conditions are given.},

  Abstract                 = {To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological and social systems, we introduce an information theoretic approach that reveals community structure in weighted and directed networks. We use the probability flow of random walks on a network as a proxy for information flows in the real system and decompose the network into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of >6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network-including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine-information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},

  Abstract                 = {A partitioning approach called ratio cut is proposed. The authors demonstrate that the ratio cut algorithm can locate the clustering structures in the circuit. Finding the optimal ratio cut is NP-complete. However, in certain cases the ratio cut can be solved by linear programming techniques via the multicommodity flow problem. They also propose a fast heuristic algorithm running in linear time with respect to the number of pins in the circuit. Experiments show good results in all tested cases, and as much as 70% improvement over the Kernighan-Lin algorithm in terms of the proposed ratio metric},
